/******************************************************************************
* A Node<E> provides a generic node for a linked list. Each node 
* contains a piece of data (which is a reference to an E object) and a link
* (which is a reference to the next node of the list). The reference stored
* in a node can be null.
*
* @note
*   Lists of nodes can be made of any length, limited only by the amount of
*   free memory in the heap. But beyond Integer.MAX_VALUE (2,147,483,647),
*   the answer from listLength is incorrect because of arithmetic
*   overflow.
