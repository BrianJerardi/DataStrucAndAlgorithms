DataStrucAndAlgorithms
======================

Implementation of some Data Structures and Algorithms.


This is some sample code written by Brian Jerardi to demonstrate different 
data structures and algorithms.

1. datastrucandalgorithms.bags.IntCircularLinkedBagDriver - 
    Demonstrates an IntCircularLinkedBag as a collection of int numbers.
2. datastrucandalgorithms.bags.RandomSentences - 
    Ask the user for 10 nouns and 10 verbs and creates random sentences, 
    using a linked bag.
3. datastrucandalgorithms.bags.StringKeyedBagDriver - 
    Demonstrates a keyed bag for data type String.
4. datastrucandalgorithms.linkedlist.LineList - 
    Write a line to the screen containing all integers in the list that are 
    between the first occurrence of x and the first occurrence of y,
    using Nodes of a linked list.
5. datastrucandalgorithms.linkedlist.LinkedListSplit - 
    Create two lists from an original list based on a splitting value,
    using a linked list.
6. datastrucandalgorithms.linkedlist.PolyDriver - 
    Demonstrates the PolyNode Class which is a node for storing 
    Polynomial terms, and PolyLinkedList which is a linked list 
    to manage Polynomials using PolyNodes.
7. datastrucandalgorithms.sequence.DoubleArraySortedSeqDriver - 
    Demonstrates a sorted sequence as a collection of double numbers.
8. datastrucandalgorithms.sequence.DoublyLinkedSeqDriver - 
    Demonstrates and implementation of a sequence class 
    using a double linked list.
9. datastrucandalgorithms.queues.PriorityQueueDriver - 
    Demonstrates a priority queue.
10. datastrucandalgorithms.queues.WordByWordPalindrome - 
    Uses a queue, linked list, and stack 
    to check a sentence to see if it is a word-by-word palindrome.
11. datastrucandalgorithms.trees.CBTBagDriver - 
    Demonstrates a complete binary tree bag using an ArrayList.
12. datastrucandalgorithms.trees.CBTBag2Driver - 
    Demonstrates a complete binary tree bag using an IntBTNode.
